# 100 Days of Code Challenge - Progress Log

## Day 1: [June 6, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**
- Started working on some codewar's challenges using python
- I learned how to use function in python 
- I also worked with List Data Structure to store multiple values and reference them using a single variable.
- I learned how to iterate over a list using for loop in python with the range function

**Thoughts:**
  I'm excited to kick off my 100 Days of Code challenge! The first day went    well, and I          made good progress. I enjoyed working with python list data structure and also function. I        was able to create a function which takes in an alphanumeric string as an argument and            return the number of times a distinct case-insensitive character occur. I also worked on          solving another code challenge from codewars. I created a function which takes in a number        and return the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below the given number. 0 if the number is          negative. It was a great first day, I learned a lot working with function in python as well       iterating over python list. Which is used to stored multiple values and reference them all        using a single variable. Looking forward to tomorrow!


## Day 2: [June 7, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**
- Continuation from the previous day, I worked on solving more codewar python challenges
- Learn about binary addition in python, solved more problems on List Data Structure and            continue to work with function in python
- I learned how to reverse a string by using  some of python's built-in methods for list
  and string

**Thoughts:**
  The second day of my 100 Days of Code challenge went well, I started off with the continuation    from the previous day, I was able to improve on my learning by working more with list and         string in python. I wrote a function that takes in a string and return the reverse of that        string if the words in the string is five or more characters long, if not just return the         string itself. I did this while working with some built-in methods of list and string. 
  
  To further understand string built-in methods, I wrote a function that validate an ATM machine    pin code. Pin has to be five or six digits long and this function accepts a single string         argument and return True if PIN is Valid, False if not. Inorder this achieve this, I used one     of python's buit-in string methods call isdigit(), which checks a string and return True, if      the string contains only digit, and return False otherwise. I then used the len function to       check the len of the pin and store the value in a variable and later compare the value if it is   equal to 4 or 6. 
  
  Today, was great and Tomorrow the journey continue
