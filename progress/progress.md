# 100 Days of Code Challenge - Progress Log

## Day 1: [June 6, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**

- Started working on some codewar's challenges using python
- I learned how to use function in python
- I also worked with List Data Structure to store multiple values and reference them using a single variable.
- I learned how to iterate over a list using for loop in python with the range function

**Thoughts:**

- I'm excited to kick off my 100 Days of Code challenge! The first day went well, and I made good progress. I enjoyed working with python list data structure and also function. I was able to create a function which takes in an alphanumeric string as an argument and return the number of times a distinct case-insensitive character occur. I also worked on solving another code challenge from codewars. I created a function which takes in a number and return the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below the given number. 0 if the number is negative. It was a great first day, I learned a lot working with function in python as well iterating over python list. Which is used to stored multiple values and reference them all using a single variable. Looking forward to tomorrow!

## Day 2: [June 7, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**

- Continuation from the previous day, I worked on solving more codewar python challenges
- Learn about binary addition in python, solved more problems on List Data Structure and continue to work with function in python
- I learned how to reverse a string by using some of python's built-in methods for list
  and string

**Thoughts:**

- The second day of my 100 Days of Code challenge went well, I started off with the continuation from the previous day, I was able to improve on my learning by working more with list and string in python. I wrote a function that takes in a string and return the reverse of that string if the words in the string is five or more characters long, if not just return the string itself. I did this while working with some built-in methods of list and string.
- To further understand string built-in methods, I wrote a function that validate an ATM machine pin code. Pin has to be five or six digits long and this function accepts a single string argument and return True if PIN is Valid, False if not. Inorder this achieve this, I used one of python's buit-in string methods call isdigit(), which checks a string and return True, if the string contains only digit, and return False otherwise. I then used the len function to check the len of the pin and store the value in a variable and later compare the value if it is equal to 4 or 6.

  Today, was great and Tomorrow the journey continue

## Day 3: [June 8, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**

- Today, I learned a bit about python dictionary data structure. I was able to use it in a function to determine the order of braces in a string. Dictionaries in python are used to store elements in key-value pairs. It is similar to a real-life dictionary where we have words and their corresponding meaning. Here, the word is the key and the value is the definition of the word.

- I did some Javascript challenges from codewars
- Wrote a function to validate an ATM PIN using regular expression in JavaScript
- Working more with regular expression, I wrote a funtion that counts lowercase letter in a string and return the total number of times it appears.
- I wrote a function that capitalize letters in even & odd indexes seperately in a string and return an array of both even and odd string version.

**Thoughts:**

- Third day of my 100 Days of Code challenge went well, I had some personal issues today, but in the end I was able to do some challenges on codewars. I wrote a function in python that validates a string of braces. This function accepts a string of braces and determine if the order of the braces is valid or not using python list. I was able to validate the order of the braces by implementing the stack data structure with list and also using python dictionary to determine if the order of the braces is valid or not.

- Working with regular expression in javascript, I created a function **validatePIN** - that validates an ATM pin by checking if length of the pin is equal 4 or 6 and then check if the pin only contains only digits using the regex **/^\d+$s** with the **test** method and passing in the pin as an argument to the method

- Still using regular expression with javascript, I wrote a function that counts lowercase letter in a string and return the number of times it appears in the string using the match method. I created the regex and run it against the string and pass in the regex as an argument to the match method. match method returns an array of matches or null if there is no match. if there is a match, I return the len or if not, return 0.

- I learned about string and array in Javascript and how to iterate over them. I wrote a function that takes a string argument and split that string into an array using the string method **split** which splits a string and return an array. Using the array method forEach, I accessed the index of each element in the array return by split method. And then check if the index is 0 or if the index modules 2 is equal to 0, in this case it is an even index, then change the character at that index to uppercase and push it to the even array. To get the odd element at index, i checked if the index modules 2 is not equal to 0.

## Day 4: [June 9, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**

- I continue to horn my skills in python by practicing on working with list and dictionary in python. I solve some coding problems using list and dictionary. I wrote a function that checks whether two array or list have the same elements and return True of they have the same or False otherwise. I also wrote a function that encode roman numerals. This function takes an integer between (1 and 3999) both included and return a string representation of the number in roman numerals.

**Thoughts**

- Working with list and dictionary in python gives you the ability to do cool stuff with data. It allows you to iterate over a bunch of data and performs different kinds of operation on them. With dictionary, you can store data in key value pairs. There are lots of application scenarios with list and dictionary and am excited to work with them.
