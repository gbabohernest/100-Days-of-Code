# 100 Days of Code Challenge - Progress Log

## Day 1: [June 6, 2023]

**Today's Progress:**
- Started working on some codewar's challenges using python
- I learned how to use function in python 
- I also worked with List Data Structure to store multiple values and reference them using a single variable.
- I learned how to iterate over a list using for loop in python with the range function

**Thoughts:**
  I'm excited to kick off my 100 Days of Code challenge! The first day went    well, and I       made good progress. I enjoyed working with python list data structure and also function. I     was able to create a function which takes in an alphanumeric string as an argument and         return the number of times a distinct case-insensitive character occur. I also worked on       solving another code challenge from codewars. I created a function which takes in a number     and return the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below the given number. 0 if the number is       negative. It was a great first day, I learned a lot working with function in python as well    iterating over python list. Which is used to stored multiple values and reference them all     using a single variable. Looking forward to tomorrow!
